This repo is to demonstrate my understanding of PLSQL in a Oracle EBS evvironment. 

## 1. GL_Inbound_Package

This package is written to import data from an external source into GL_INTERFACE table

## 2. Purchase_Order_Inbound_Package

This package also imports data from an external source but this one deals with Purchase Order.

## 3. Inventory_Outbound_Procedure

This procedure is to export data from the Inventory module. 

## 4. EBS_Application_Tasks

These are tasks to demonstrate my understanding of navigating the Oracle EBS Application across different modules in Supply Chain and Financial etc.
